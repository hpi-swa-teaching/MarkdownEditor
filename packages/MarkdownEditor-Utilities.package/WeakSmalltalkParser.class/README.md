A WeakSmalltalkParser parses a method without looking up any information about the existence of message selectors, instance variables, global variables, class variables or pool dictionaries. Instead, it treats every message selector finds as one that actually exists and every identifier that could be one of the before-mentioned variable types as a global variable if it is capitalized or an instance variable if it is not.
