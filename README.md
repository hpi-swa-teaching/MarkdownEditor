**MarkdownEditor** is a tool enabling Squeak users to write Markdown in Squeak with highlighting. The Editor is designed to *focus on the Markdown you write*, no other distractions.

## Features

The editor works like a normal workspace, but highlights the Markdown as you type. You can save the text as usual and also copy into and from the window.  
It is by no means feature complete. But the aspects we included, are conforming to the [Github Flavored Markdown Specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Travis
As of now there are issues with reporting the coverage from Github-Actions to Coveralls, which is why we still have
